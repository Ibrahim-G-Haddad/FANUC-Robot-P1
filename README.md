# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
## INTRODUCTION
This project involves a FANUC robot program written in the KAREL programming language, controlling the robot arm movements and vacuum functionality for a pick and place task. The program guides the robot arm to perform a 2x2 grid pick and place operation with a vacuum gripper, moving objects from one location to another.

### Goals and Objectives
The goal of the project is to develop a reliable and efficient robotic solution for the pick and place task, improving productivity and reducing labor costs in manufacturing and automation tasks.

### Key Features
The key features of the project include:

* Robot arm movements and vacuum functionality control.
* 2x2 grid pick and place operation with a vacuum gripper.
* Custom subroutines for turning vacuum on/off and updating positions and offsets.

## PROJECT TEAM
### Customer Information
The customer who commissioned the project is a manufacturing company in need of an automated solution for their pick and place tasks, aiming to increase productivity and reduce labor costs.

### Developer Information
The developer involved in the project is Ibrahim G. Haddad, who wrote the FANUC robot program in KAREL programming language.

## PROJECT PLAN
### Timeline
The project plan includes a timeline of deliverables and deadlines for the project, outlining what work will be done and when. The timeline should be updated regularly to reflect the project's progress.

### Milestone
The key milestones of the project include:

* Successful development of the robot program.
* Testing and debugging of the program.
* Integration of the program with the FANUC robot system.
* Deployment and implementation of the program in the manufacturing company's facility.

## HIGH LEVEL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
### Architecture
The system architecture includes the FANUC robot system and the KAREL programming language, which controls the robot arm movements and vacuum functionality. The program utilizes custom subroutines for turning vacuum on/off and updating positions and offsets.

### Functionality
The program controls the robot arm movements and vacuum functionality for a 2x2 grid pick and place operation with a vacuum gripper. The program utilizes nested loops and custom subroutines to guide the robot across the grid.

# TECHNICAL INFORMATION
## REQUIREMENTS 
The technical requirements for the project include the FANUC robot system and the KAREL programming language.

## CHALLENGES
Potential technical challenges in the project could include debugging the program and integrating it with the FANUC robot system.

## PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS
### Version
TBD.

### Dependencies
TBD.

## TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION

# PROJECT STATUS
## CURRENT STATUS
### Ongoing Development
The project is half way done, still need to integrate the camera and make the robot pick the cans automatically and stack them in a larger matrix. 

### Issues
integrating the camera within the code needs a lot of debbuging.

## NEXT STEPS
### Upcoming Work
Upcoming work includes testing and debugging the program, integrating it with the FANUC robot system, and deploying it in the manufacturing company's facility.

### To-Do-List
List any to-do items that need to be completed, and provide a timeline for when each will be done.
